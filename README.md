# Library-Managment

Aim was to create a library management system that is user friendly. The 
software is capable enough to allow the concerned person to store 
and retrieve any type of book record.
The users of the directory will have the authority to search any particular 
record and list details of all available records. The users can perform
various operations such as adding book records, searching any particular 
record, deleting records, modifying existing records etc. To provide the 
search result within a short interval of time, optimized search algorithm 
code has been incorporated which will provide the results within 
seconds.
